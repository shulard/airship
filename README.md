## Benefits of CMS Airship

1. [**Digitally signed automatic security updates.**](https://github.com/paragonie/airship/tree/master/docs/en-us/WHY.md#1-digitally-signed-automatic-security-updates)
2. [Community first.](https://github.com/paragonie/airship/tree/master/docs/en-us/WHY.md#2-the-community-is-always-in-control-of-any-add-ons-it-produces)
   The community is always in control of any add-ons it produces. No one
   can backdoor your extensions without your signing keys.
3. [Supports a multi-site architecture out of the box.](https://github.com/paragonie/airship/tree/master/docs/en-us/WHY.md#3-supports-a-multi-site-architecture-out-of-the-box)
4. [Designed by progressive-minded application security professionals.](https://github.com/paragonie/airship/tree/master/docs/en-us/WHY.md#4-designed-by-progressive-minded-application-security-professionals)
5. [Fully customizable and extensible.](https://github.com/paragonie/airship/tree/master/docs/en-us/WHY.md#5-our-gear-system-allows-the-framework-to-be-extended)
   Our `Gears` system allows extensions to easily restructure and/or
   replace entire Airship features without causing conflicts with our
   secure automatic updating process.
